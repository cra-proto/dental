		   <summary>How shared custody benefit amounts were split</summary>
		   <p>If your child only lived with you part-time, you may have been considered to have shared custody for the Canada Child Benefit (CCB). You would have received half of the dental benefit amount if you shared custody of your child and were splitting the CCB.</p>
<p>Both parents could have applied for the dental benefit if they were eligible. The amount you received would have been 50% of the benefit amount based on your own adjusted family net income. This means you may have received a different amount than your child's other parent.</p>
<p>The dental benefit used the same custody arrangement as the CCB as of:</p>
<ul>
<li>December&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2022 for the first benefit period</li>
<li>July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2023 for the second benefit period</li>
</ul>
</details>
		  <p>The Canada Revenue Agency used your adjusted family net income from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2021 for dental care received between October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2022 and June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2023</li>
